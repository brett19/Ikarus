Input Manager gets polled.
Input Manager calls its event listener ( Overlay Manager )
The overlay manager processes the event and returns a value, determining if it was processed or not.
If the above function returns false, the engine passes the event to its own event listener.
The event has propagated completely, and should have been processed




Be careful with the overlay and input managers, since the input manager passes events directly to the overlay manager!
